<p>At EZ Bayan, we are passionate about making sure both children and adults easily understand the classical Arabic vocabulary found in the Qur’an. Our team is a mixture of native Arabic teachers who have taught English to Arabic speakers and thus understand the challenges of teaching a foreign language. And includes non-native Arabic speakers who understand the challenges of learning Arabic.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is simple: understanding Qur'anic vocabulary is like swimming. You can read and listen as much as you want about swimming. But you will never learn until you actually dive in and try it out yourself.</p>
<p>For that reason, you will find that we have a lot of quizzes to ensure a person really understands just one word in the Qur'an. You’ll find 10-15 practice questions for a single Arabic word! But to keep the kids engaged, we make the whole process very game-like and entertaining.</p>
<p>Don't take our word for it. Try it out yourself to see the difference between EZ Bayan and all the other Arabic sites for children and adults.</p>
